The main focus of my analysis was answering this questions:

### 1.  What is the most demanded position for remote jobs?
To analyze the demand for various data roles in remote jobs, I first established a view called european_job_postings which encompasses job postings located in Europe or tagged as remote-friendly. Utilizing this view, I executed a query to filter for remote jobs (job_location = 'Anywhere'). This query aggregates the data to count the total postings for each job title and calculates the average yearly salary for these roles, providing a clear picture of the most demanded positions in the remote job market. 

```sql
SELECT
    job_title_short AS job_title,
    COUNT(*) AS total_remote_jobs,
    AVG(salary_year_avg) AS avg_yearly_salary
FROM european_job_postings
WHERE
    job_location = 'Anywhere'
GROUP BY
    job_title_short
ORDER BY
    total_remote_jobs DESC;
```
Here is the breakdown of the most demanded position for remote jobs:

### 2. What is the most demanded position for jobs in Europe?
To analyze the demand for various data roles in European jobs, I first established a view called european_job_postings which encompasses job postings located in Europe or tagged as remote-friendly. Utilizing this view, I executed a query to filter for remote jobs (job_location != 'Anywhere'). This query aggregates the data to count the total postings for each job title and calculates the average yearly salary for these roles, providing a clear picture of the most demanded positions in the European job market.


```sql
SELECT
    job_title_short AS job_title,
    COUNT(*) AS total_jobs,
    AVG(salary_year_avg) AS avg_yearly_salary
FROM european_job_postings
WHERE
    job_location != 'Anywhere'
GROUP BY
    job_title_short
ORDER BY
    total_jobs DESC;
```

Here is the breakdown of the most demanded position for remote jobs:

### 3. Which European country has the highest demand for data professionals?
To determine which European country shows the highest demand for data professionals, I utilized the european_job_postings view, which includes job postings from European countries and remote jobs. From this data subset, I crafted a query using two Common Table Expressions (CTEs). The first CTE, jobs_by_country_and_role, aggregates the total number of job postings by country and by job title, excluding remote jobs. The second CTE, total_jobs_by_country, calculates the total number of job postings per country. These CTEs enable a sorted display of countries with the highest job demand, alongside the most demanded roles within those countries, thus providing a clear perspective on where data professionals are most sought after.

``` sql
WITH jobs_by_country_and_role AS (
    SELECT
        job_country AS country,
        job_title_short AS job_title,
        COUNT(*) AS total_jobs    
    FROM european_job_postings
    WHERE
        job_location != 'Anywhere'
    GROUP BY
        job_country, job_title_short
), 
total_jobs_by_country AS (
    SELECT
        job_country AS country,
        COUNT(*) AS total_country_jobs    
    FROM european_job_postings
    WHERE
        job_location != 'Anywhere'
    GROUP BY
        job_country
)

SELECT
    jobs_by_country_and_role.country,
    jobs_by_country_and_role.job_title,
    jobs_by_country_and_role.total_jobs
FROM jobs_by_country_and_role
LEFT JOIN total_jobs_by_country
ON jobs_by_country_and_role.country = total_jobs_by_country.country
ORDER BY
    total_jobs_by_country.total_country_jobs DESC,
    jobs_by_country_and_role.total_jobs DESC;
```

Here is the breakdown of countries with more demand for data professionals:

France leads with significant demand for Data Analysts, Engineers, and Scientists, highlighting the country's thriving tech sector. Considering learning French could provide a competitive edge in the European job market.

### 4. What are the top skills required for the main data roles?

To uncover the top skills required for the primary data roles within the European and remote job markets, I combined information from the european_job_postings, skills_dim, and skills_job_dim tables. By using inner joins, I ensured only jobs with associated skills were included in the analysis. The query is structured around two Common Table Expressions (CTEs): the first CTE, top_data_analyst_skills, groups and counts the job postings by skill for a specified data role, in this case, 'Data Analyst'. The second CTE, total_jobs, tallies the total number of job postings for the role. With this setup, I then calculate the percentage of job postings demanding each skill, providing a clear insight into which skills are most critical for Data Analysts in the current job market. I did this, also for Data Scientis and Data Engineer roles.

```sql
WITH top_data_analyst_skills AS (
    SELECT
        s.skills AS skill,
        COUNT(jp.job_id) AS jobs_demanded_skill
    FROM european_job_postings AS jp
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim AS sj ON jp.job_id = sj.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim AS s ON sj.skill_id = s.skill_id
    WHERE
        jp.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    GROUP BY
        s.skills
),
total_jobs AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_jobs
    FROM european_job_postings
    WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
)
SELECT
    t.skill,
    t.jobs_demanded_skill,
    ROUND((t.jobs_demanded_skill * 100.0 / total.total_jobs), 2) AS percentage_of_jobs
FROM top_data_analyst_skills AS t, total_jobs AS total
ORDER BY
    t.jobs_demanded_skill DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

Here is the breakdown of top skills required for the main data roles:

- SQL, Python, and Excel are critical for Data Analysts, indicating foundational tools for data manipulation and analysis are essential in this role. Choosing between Power BI or Tableau could further enhance your analytical capabilities

- Similar queries for Data Scientist and Data Engineer roles elucidate that Python and SQL are foundational, with cloud technologies and specific tools like Spark also critical for advanced data processing roles
